# wrestd

My standard C++ library. This basically is just a collection of my most-used classes/methods. Some classes may have better documentation in comments than the others do. This is simply because I don't plan on other people using this, and I already know what the things all do. In any case, most or all methods have short comments above their definitions that will tell you what they do.

## Usage

This library is all headers, so you don't need to put any special effort into using them. Just include the headers and move on.
